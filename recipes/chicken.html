        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat convection oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li><br>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74
                degrees C).
            </li><br>
            <li>Remove chicken from pan. Pour water into the pan, while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add more water if needed to dislodge the browned bits; serve alongside chicken.</li>
